![alt text](https://github.com/johnw1llliam/Delicious_India/blob/main/Screenshots.png?raw=true)


An app with build in AI to help finding out the name of the food and build in encyclopedia for reading more about the food. This app is aimed to help traveller exploring vast cuisine of India.
<br><br>
The app is made using Flutter and the AI used in the app can be checked <a href="https://github.com/johnw1llliam/Indian_Food_Classification">here</a>. The images, icons, and information are from various website, I don't own them and the use of this app is not for commercial purpose rather a portofolio.
<br><br>
The number of food in the apps match the number of food used to train the AI due to lack of manpower and resources. Feel free to try my app and if you have any advices, critiques, or if you happen to find any bugs feel free to reach out ðŸ˜‰.
